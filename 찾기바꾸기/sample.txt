Matthew 
11 A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham
12 Abraham was the father of Isaac Isaac the father of Jacob Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers
13 Judah the father of Perez and Zerah whose mother was Tamar Perez the father of Hezron Hezron the father of Ram
14 Ram the father of Amminadab Amminadab the father of Nahshon Nahshon the father of Salmon
15 Salmon the father of Boaz whose mother was Rahab Boaz the father of Obed whose mother was Ruth Obed the father of Jesse
16 and Jesse the father of King David David was the father of Solomon whose mother had been Uriahs wife
17 Solomon the father of Rehoboam Rehoboam the father of Abijah Abijah the father of Asa
18 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram Jehoram the father of Uzziah
19 Uzziah the father of Jotham Jotham the father of Ahaz Ahaz the father of Hezekiah
110 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh Manasseh the father of Amon Amon the father of Josiah
111 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon
112 After the exile to Babylon Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel
113 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud Abiud the father of Eliakim Eliakim the father of Azor
114 Azor the father of Zadok Zadok the father of Akim Akim the father of Eliud
115 Eliud the father of Eleazar Eleazar the father of Matthan Matthan the father of Jacob
116 and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ
117 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon and fourteen from the exile to the Christ
118 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph but before they came together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit
119 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace he had in mind to divorce her quietly
120 But after he had considered this an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said Joseph son of David do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit
121 She will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins
122 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet
123 The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him Immanuelwhich means God with us
124 When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife
125 But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son And he gave him the name Jesus 
21 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
22 and asked Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him
23 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him
24 When he had called together all the peoples chief priests and teachers of the law he asked them where the Christ was to be born
25 In Bethlehem in Judea they replied for this is what the prophet has written
26 But you Bethlehem in the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel
27 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared
28 He sent them to Bethlehem and said Go and make a careful search for the child As soon as you find him report to me so that I too may go and worship him
29 After they had heard the king they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was
210 When they saw the star they were overjoyed
211 On coming to the house they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh
212 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod they returned to their country by another route
213 When they had gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream Get up he said take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt Stay there until I tell you for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him
214 So he got up took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt
215 where he stayed until the death of Herod And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet Out of Egypt I called my son
216 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi
217 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled
218 A voice is heard in Ramah weeping and great mourning Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more
219 After Herod died an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
220 and said Get up take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel for those who were trying to take the childs life are dead
221 So he got up took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel
222 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod he was afraid to go there Having been warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee
223 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets He will be called a Nazarene 
31 In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Desert of Judea
32 and saying Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near
33 This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah A voice of one calling in the desert Prepare the way for the Lord make straight paths for him
34 Johns clothes were made of camels hair and he had a leather belt around his waist His food was locusts and wild honey
35 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan
36 Confessing their sins they were baptized by him in the Jordan River
37 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing he said to them You brood of vipers Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath
38 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance
39 And do not think you can say to yourselves We have Abraham as our father I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham
310 The ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire
311 I baptize you with water for repentance But after me will come one who is more powerful than I whose sandals I am not fit to carry He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire
312 His winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire
313 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John
314 But John tried to deter him saying I need to be baptized by you and do you come to me
315 Jesus replied Let it be so now it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness Then John consented
316 As soon as Jesus was baptized he went up out of the water At that moment heaven was opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him
317 And a voice from heaven said This is my Son whom I love with him I am well pleased 
41 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil
42 After fasting forty days and forty nights he was hungry
43 The tempter came to him and said If you are the Son of God tell these stones to become bread
44 Jesus answered It is written Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God
45 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple
46 If you are the Son of God he said throw yourself down For it is written He will command his angels concerning you and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone
47 Jesus answered him It is also written Do not put the Lord your God to the test
48 Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor
49 All this I will give you he said if you will bow down and worship me
410 Jesus said to him Away from me Satan For it is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only
411 Then the devil left him and angels came and attended him
412 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison he returned to Galilee
413 Leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali
414 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah
415 Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali the way to the sea along the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles
416 the people living in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned
417 From that time on Jesus began to preach Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near
418 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew They were casting a net into the lake for they were fishermen
419 Come follow me Jesus said and I will make you fishers of men
420 At once they left their nets and followed him
421 Going on from there he saw two other brothers James son of Zebedee and his brother John They were in a boat with their father Zebedee preparing their nets Jesus called them
422 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him
423 Jesus went throughout Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness among the people
424 News about him spread all over Syria and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases those suffering severe pain the demonpossessed those having seizures and the paralyzed and he healed them
425 Large crowds from Galilee the Decapolis Jerusalem Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him 
51 Now when he saw the crowds he went up on a mountainside and sat down His disciples came to him
52 and he began to teach them saying
53 Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
54 Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted
55 Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth
56 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
57 Blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy
58 Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God
59 Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God
510 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
511 Blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me
512 Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you
513 You are the salt of the earth But if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men
514 You are the light of the world A city on a hill cannot be hidden
515 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl Instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house
516 In the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven
517 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
518 I tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished
519 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven
520 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven
521 You have heard that it was said to the people long ago Do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment
522 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment Again anyone who says to his brother Raca is answerable to the Sanhedrin But anyone who says You fool will be in danger of the fire of hell
523 Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you
524 leave your gift there in front of the altar First go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift
525 Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court Do it while you are still with him on the way or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison
526 I tell you the truth you will not get out until you have paid the last penny
527 You have heard that it was said Do not commit adultery
528 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
529 If your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell
530 And if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell
531 It has been said Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce
532 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness causes her to become an adulteress and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery
533 Again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago Do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord
534 But I tell you Do not swear at all either by heaven for it is Gods throne
535 or by the earth for it is his footstool or by Jerusalem for it is the city of the Great King
536 And do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black
537 Simply let your Yes be Yes and your No No anything beyond this comes from the evil one
538 You have heard that it was said Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
539 But I tell you Do not resist an evil person If someone strikes you on the right cheek turn to him the other also
540 And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic let him have your cloak as well
541 If someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles
542 Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you
543 You have heard that it was said Love your neighbor and hate your enemy
544 But I tell you Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
545 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous
546 If you love those who love you what reward will you get Are not even the tax collectors doing that
547 And if you greet only your brothers what are you doing more than others Do not even pagans do that
548 Be perfect therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect 
61 Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them If you do you will have no reward from your Father in heaven
62 So when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
63 But when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
64 so that your giving may be in secret Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
65 And when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
66 But when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen Then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
67 And when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words
68 Do not be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him
69 This then is how you should pray Our Father in heaven hallowed be your name
610 your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
611 Give us today our daily bread
612 Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
613 And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one
614 For if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly Father will also forgive you
615 But if you do not forgive men their sins your Father will not forgive your sins
616 When you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting I tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
617 But when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face
618 so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting but only to your Father who is unseen and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
619 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
620 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal
621 For where your treasure is there your heart will be also
622 The eye is the lamp of the body If your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light
623 But if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness If then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness
624 No one can serve two masters Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You cannot serve both God and Money
625 Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear Is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
626 Look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them Are you not much more valuable than they
627 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life
628 And why do you worry about clothes See how the lilies of the field grow They do not labor or spin
629 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these
630 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you O you of little faith
631 So do not worry saying What shall we eat or What shall we drink or What shall we wear
632 For the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them
633 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well
634 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself Each day has enough trouble of its own 
71 Do not judge or you too will be judged
72 For in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you
73 Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
74 How can you say to your brother Let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye
75 You hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye
76 Do not give dogs what is sacred do not throw your pearls to pigs If you do they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces
77 Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you
78 For everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
79 Which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone
710 Or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake
711 If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him
712 So in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the Law and the Prophets
713 Enter through the narrow gate For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it
714 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it
715 Watch out for false prophets They come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves
716 By their fruit you will recognize them Do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles
717 Likewise every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit
718 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit
719 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
720 Thus by their fruit you will recognize them
721 Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven
722 Many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles
723 Then I will tell them plainly I never knew you Away from me you evildoers
724 Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock
725 The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock
726 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand
727 The rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash
728 When Jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were amazed at his teaching
729 because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law 
81 When he came down from the mountainside large crowds followed him
82 A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said Lord if you are willing you can make me clean
83 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man I am willing he said Be clean Immediately he was cured of his leprosy
84 Then Jesus said to him See that you dont tell anyone But go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded as a testimony to them
85 When Jesus had entered Capernaum a centurion came to him asking for help
86 Lord he said my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering
87 Jesus said to him I will go and heal him
88 The centurion replied Lord I do not deserve to have you come under my roof But just say the word and my servant will be healed
89 For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me I tell this one Go and he goes and that one Come and he comes I say to my servant Do this and he does it
810 When Jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him I tell you the truth I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith
811 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven
812 But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
813 Then Jesus said to the centurion Go It will be done just as you believed it would And his servant was healed at that very hour
814 When Jesus came into Peters house he saw Peters motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever
815 He touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to wait on him
816 When evening came many who were demonpossessed were brought to him and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick
817 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases
818 When Jesus saw the crowd around him he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake
819 Then a teacher of the law came to him and said Teacher I will follow you wherever you go
820 Jesus replied Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head
821 Another disciple said to him Lord first let me go and bury my father
822 But Jesus told him Follow me and let the dead bury their own dead
823 Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him
824 Without warning a furious storm came up on the lake so that the waves swept over the boat But Jesus was sleeping
825 The disciples went and woke him saying Lord save us Were going to drown
826 He replied You of little faith why are you so afraid Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves and it was completely calm
827 The men were amazed and asked What kind of man is this Even the winds and the waves obey him
828 When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes two demonpossessed men coming from the tombs met him They were so violent that no one could pass that way
829 What do you want with us Son of God they shouted Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time
830 Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding
831 The demons begged Jesus If you drive us out send us into the herd of pigs
832 He said to them Go So they came out and went into the pigs and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water
833 Those tending the pigs ran off went into the town and reported all this including what had happened to the demonpossessed men
834 Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus And when they saw him they pleaded with him to leave their region 
91 Jesus stepped into a boat crossed over and came to his own town
92 Some men brought to him a paralytic lying on a mat When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic Take heart son your sins are forgiven
93 At this some of the teachers of the law said to themselves This fellow is blaspheming
94 Knowing their thoughts Jesus said Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts
95 Which is easier to say Your sins are forgiven or to say Get up and walk
96 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins Then he said to the paralytic Get up take your mat and go home
97 And the man got up and went home
98 When the crowd saw this they were filled with awe and they praised God who had given such authority to men
99 As Jesus went on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collectors booth Follow me he told him and Matthew got up and followed him
910 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthews house many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples
911 When the Pharisees saw this they asked his disciples Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
912 On hearing this Jesus said It is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick
913 But go and learn what this means I desire mercy not sacrifice For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners
914 Then Johns disciples came and asked him How is it that we and the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast
915 Jesus answered How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them then they will fast
916 No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch will pull away from the garment making the tear worse
917 Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins If they do the skins will burst the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined No they pour new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved
918 While he was saying this a ruler came and knelt before him and said My daughter has just died But come and put your hand on her and she will live
919 Jesus got up and went with him and so did his disciples
920 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak
921 She said to herself If I only touch his cloak I will be healed
922 Jesus turned and saw her Take heart daughter he said your faith has healed you And the woman was healed from that moment
923 When Jesus entered the rulers house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd
924 he said Go away The girl is not dead but asleep But they laughed at him
925 After the crowd had been put outside he went in and took the girl by the hand and she got up
926 News of this spread through all that region
927 As Jesus went on from there two blind men followed him calling out Have mercy on us Son of David
928 When he had gone indoors the blind men came to him and he asked them Do you believe that I am able to do this Yes Lord they replied
929 Then he touched their eyes and said According to your faith will it be done to you
930 and their sight was restored Jesus warned them sternly See that no one knows about this
931 But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region
932 While they were going out a man who was demonpossessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus
933 And when the demon was driven out the man who had been mute spoke The crowd was amazed and said Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel
934 But the Pharisees said It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons
935 Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness
936 When he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
937 Then he said to his disciples The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few
938 Ask the Lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field 
101 He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness
102 These are the names of the twelve apostles first Simon who is called Peter and his brother Andrew James son of Zebedee and his brother John
103 Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the tax collector James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus
104 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him
105 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans
106 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel
107 As you go preach this message The kingdom of heaven is near
108 Heal the sick raise the dead cleanse those who have leprosy drive out demons Freely you have received freely give
109 Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts
1010 take no bag for the journey or extra tunic or sandals or a staff for the worker is worth his keep
1011 Whatever town or village you enter search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave
1012 As you enter the home give it your greeting
1013 If the home is deserving let your peace rest on it if it is not let your peace return to you
1014 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town
1015 I tell you the truth it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town
1016 I am sending you out like sheep among wolves Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves
1017 Be on your guard against men they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues
1018 On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles
1019 But when they arrest you do not worry about what to say or how to say it At that time you will be given what to say
1020 for it will not be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you
1021 Brother will betray brother to death and a father his child children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death
1022 All men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved
1023 When you are persecuted in one place flee to another I tell you the truth you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes
1024 A student is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master
1025 It is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub how much more the members of his household
1026 So do not be afraid of them There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known
1027 What I tell you in the dark speak in the daylight what is whispered in your ear proclaim from the roofs
1028 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul Rather be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell
1029 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father
1030 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered
1031 So dont be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows
1032 Whoever acknowledges me before men I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven
1033 But whoever disowns me before men I will disown him before my Father in heaven
1034 Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth I did not come to bring peace but a sword
1035 For I have come to turn a man against his father a daughter against her mother a daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw
1036 a mans enemies will be the members of his own household
1037 Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
1038 and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
1039 Whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
1040 He who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives the one who sent me
1041 Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophets reward and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward
1042 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple I tell you the truth he will certainly not lose his reward MAT 
111 After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee
112 When John heard in prison what Christ was doing he sent his disciples
113 to ask him Are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else
114 Jesus replied Go back and report to John what you hear and see
115 The blind receive sight the lame walk those who have leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor
116 Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me
117 As Johns disciples were leaving Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John What did you go out into the desert to see A reed swayed by the wind
118 If not what did you go out to see A man dressed in fine clothes No those who wear fine clothes are in kings palaces
119 Then what did you go out to see A prophet Yes I tell you and more than a prophet
1110 This is the one about whom it is written I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you
1111 I tell you the truth Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
1112 From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it
1113 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John
1114 And if you are willing to accept it he is the Elijah who was to come
1115 He who has ears let him hear
1116 To what can I compare this generation They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others
1117 We played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not mourn
1118 For John came neither eating nor drinking and they say He has a demon
1119 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and they say Here is a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners But wisdom is proved right by her actions
1120 Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent
1121 Woe to you Korazin Woe to you Bethsaida If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
1122 But I tell you it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you
1123 And you Capernaum will you be lifted up to the skies No you will go down to the depths If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom it would have remained to this day
1124 But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you
1125 At that time Jesus said I praise you Father Lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children
1126 Yes Father for this was your good pleasure
1127 All things have been committed to me by my Father No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him
1128 Come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest
1129 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls
1130 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light 
121 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them
122 When the Pharisees saw this they said to him Look Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath
123 He answered Havent you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry
124 He entered the house of God and he and his companions ate the consecrated breadwhich was not lawful for them to do but only for the priests
125 Or havent you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent
126 I tell you that one greater than the temple is here
127 If you had known what these words mean I desire mercy not sacrifice you would not have condemned the innocent
128 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath
129 Going on from that place he went into their synagogue
1210 and a man with a shriveled hand was there Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus they asked him Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
1211 He said to them If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath will you not take hold of it and lift it out
1212 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath
1213 Then he said to the man Stretch out your hand So he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other
1214 But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus
1215 Aware of this Jesus withdrew from that place Many followed him and he healed all their sick
1216 warning them not to tell who he was
1217 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah
1218 Here is my servant whom I have chosen the one I love in whom I delight I will put my Spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations
1219 He will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear his voice in the streets
1220 A bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out till he leads justice to victory
1221 In his name the nations will put their hope
1222 Then they brought him a demonpossessed man who was blind and mute and Jesus healed him so that he could both talk and see
1223 All the people were astonished and said Could this be the Son of David
1224 But when the Pharisees heard this they said It is only by Beelzebub the prince of demons that this fellow drives out demons
1225 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined and every city or household divided against itself will not stand
1226 If Satan drives out Satan he is divided against himself How then can his kingdom stand
1227 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub by whom do your people drive them out So then they will be your judges
1228 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God has come upon you
1229 Or again how can anyone enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man Then he can rob his house
1230 He who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters
1231 And so I tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven
1232 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come
1233 Make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad for a tree is recognized by its fruit
1234 You brood of vipers how can you who are evil say anything good For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
1235 The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him
1236 But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken
1237 For by your words you will be acquitted and by your words you will be condemned
1238 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him Teacher we want to see a miraculous sign from you
1239 He answered A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah
1240 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
1241 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and now one greater than Jonah is here
1242 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomons wisdom and now one greater than Solomon is here
1243 When an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it
1244 Then it says I will return to the house I left When it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order
1245 Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there And the final condition of that man is worse than the first That is how it will be with this wicked generation
1246 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd his mother and brothers stood outside wanting to speak to him
1247 Someone told him Your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you
1248 He replied to him Who is my mother and who are my brothers
1249 Pointing to his disciples he said Here are my mother and my brothers
1250 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother 
131 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake
132 Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore
133 Then he told them many things in parables saying A farmer went out to sow his seed
134 As he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up
135 Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow
136 But when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root
137 Other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants
138 Still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a cropa hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
139 He who has ears let him hear
1310 The disciples came to him and asked Why do you speak to the people in parables
1311 He replied The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them
1312 Whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him
1313 This is why I speak to them in parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand
1314 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah You will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving
1315 For this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes Otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and I would heal them
1316 But blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear
1317 For I tell you the truth many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it
1318 Listen then to what the parable of the sower means
1319 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart This is the seed sown along the path
1320 The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy
1321 But since he has no root he lasts only a short time When trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away
1322 The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful
1323 But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it He produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown
1324 Jesus told them another parable The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field
1325 But while everyone was sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away
1326 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads then the weeds also appeared
1327 The owners servants came to him and said Sir didnt you sow good seed in your field Where then did the weeds come from
1328 An enemy did this he replied The servants asked him Do you want us to go and pull them up
1329 No he answered because while you are pulling the weeds you may root up the wheat with them
1330 Let both grow together until the harvest At that time I will tell the harvesters First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn
1331 He told them another parable The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field
1332 Though it is the smallest of all your seeds yet when it grows it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches
1333 He told them still another parable The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough
1334 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables he did not say anything to them without using a parable
1335 So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet I will open my mouth in parables I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world
1336 Then he left the crowd and went into the house His disciples came to him and said Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field
1337 He answered The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man
1338 The field is the world and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom The weeds are the sons of the evil one
1339 and the enemy who sows them is the devil The harvest is the end of the age and the harvesters are angels
1340 As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire so it will be at the end of the age
1341 The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil
1342 They will throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1343 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father He who has ears let him hear
1344 The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field When a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field
1345 Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls
1346 When he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it
1347 Once again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish
1348 When it was full the fishermen pulled it up on the shore Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets but threw the bad away
1349 This is how it will be at the end of the age The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
1350 and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
1351 Have you understood all these things Jesus asked Yes they replied
1352 He said to them Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old
1353 When Jesus had finished these parables he moved on from there
1354 Coming to his hometown he began teaching the people in their synagogue and they were amazed Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers they asked
1355 Isnt this the carpenters son Isnt his mothers name Mary and arent his brothers James Joseph Simon and Judas
1356 Arent all his sisters with us Where then did this man get all these things
1357 And they took offense at him But Jesus said to them Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor
1358 And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith 
141 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus
142 and he said to his attendants This is John the Baptist he has risen from the dead That is why miraculous powers are at work in him
143 Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias his brother Philips wife
144 for John had been saying to him It is not lawful for you to have her
145 Herod wanted to kill John but he was afraid of the people because they considered him a prophet
146 On Herods birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for them and pleased Herod so much
147 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked
148 Prompted by her mother she said Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist
149 The king was distressed but because of his oaths and his dinner guests he ordered that her request be granted
1410 and had John beheaded in the prison
1411 His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl who carried it to her mother
1412 Johns disciples came and took his body and buried it Then they went and told Jesus
1413 When Jesus heard what had happened he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place Hearing of this the crowds followed him on foot from the towns
1414 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them and healed their sick
1415 As evening approached the disciples came to him and said This is a remote place and its already getting late Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food
1416 Jesus replied They do not need to go away You give them something to eat
1417 We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish they answered
1418 Bring them here to me he said
1419 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves Then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people
1420 They all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over
1421 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men besides women and children
1422 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd
1423 After he had dismissed them he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray When evening came he was there alone
1424 but the boat was already a considerable distance from land buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it
1425 During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them walking on the lake
1426 When the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified Its a ghost they said and cried out in fear
1427 But Jesus immediately said to them Take courage It is I Dont be afraid
1428 Lord if its you Peter replied tell me to come to you on the water
1429 Come he said Then Peter got down out of the boat walked on the water and came toward Jesus
1430 But when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink cried out Lord save me
1431 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him You of little faith he said why did you doubt
1432 And when they climbed into the boat the wind died down
1433 Then those who were in the boat worshiped him saying Truly you are the Son of God
1434 When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret
1435 And when the men of that place recognized Jesus they sent word to all the surrounding country People brought all their sick to him
1436 and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak and all who touched him were healed 
151 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked
152 Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders They dont wash their hands before they eat
153 Jesus replied And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition
154 For God said Honor your father and mother and Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death
155 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God
156 he is not to honor his father with it Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition
157 You hypocrites Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you
158 These people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me
159 They worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men
1510 Jesus called the crowd to him and said Listen and understand
1511 What goes into a mans mouth does not make him unclean but what comes out of his mouth that is what makes him unclean
1512 Then the disciples came to him and asked Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this
1513 He replied Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots
1514 Leave them they are blind guides If a blind man leads a blind man both will fall into a pit
1515 Peter said Explain the parable to us
1516 Are you still so dull Jesus asked them
1517 Dont you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body
1518 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and these make a man unclean
1519 For out of the heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false testimony slander
1520 These are what make a man unclean but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean
1521 Leaving that place Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon
1522 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out Lord Son of David have mercy on me My daughter is suffering terribly from demonpossession
1523 Jesus did not answer a word So his disciples came to him and urged him Send her away for she keeps crying out after us
1524 He answered I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel
1525 The woman came and knelt before him Lord help me she said
1526 He replied It is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs
1527 Yes Lord she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
1528 Then Jesus answered Woman you have great faith Your request is granted And her daughter was healed from that very hour
1529 Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down
1530 Great crowds came to him bringing the lame the blind the crippled the mute and many others and laid them at his feet and he healed them
1531 The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking the crippled made well the lame walking and the blind seeing And they praised the God of Israel
1532 Jesus called his disciples to him and said I have compassion for these people they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat I do not want to send them away hungry or they may collapse on the way
1533 His disciples answered Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd
1534 How many loaves do you have Jesus asked Seven they replied and a few small fish
1535 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground
1536 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and when he had given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and they in turn to the people
1537 They all ate and were satisfied Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over
1538 The number of those who ate was four thousand besides women and children
1539 After Jesus had sent the crowd away he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan 
161 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven
162 He replied When evening comes you say It will be fair weather for the sky is red
163 and in the morning Today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times
164 A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah Jesus then left them and went away
165 When they went across the lake the disciples forgot to take bread
166 Be careful Jesus said to them Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
167 They discussed this among themselves and said It is because we didnt bring any bread
168 Aware of their discussion Jesus asked You of little faith why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread
169 Do you still not understand Dont you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered
1610 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered
1611 How is it you dont understand that I was not talking to you about bread But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
1612 Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees
1613 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples Who do people say the Son of Man is
1614 They replied Some say John the Baptist others say Elijah and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
1615 But what about you he asked Who do you say I am
1616 Simon Peter answered You are the Christ the Son of the living God
1617 Jesus replied Blessed are you Simon son of Jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my Father in heaven
1618 And I tell you that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not overcome it
1619 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
1620 Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ
1621 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life
1622 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him Never Lord he said This shall never happen to you
1623 Jesus turned and said to Peter Get behind me Satan You are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of God but the things of men
1624 Then Jesus said to his disciples If anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
1625 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it
1626 What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul
1627 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done
1628 I tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom 
171 After six days Jesus took with him Peter James and John the brother of James and led them up a high mountain by themselves
172 There he was transfigured before them His face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light
173 Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus
174 Peter said to Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here If you wish I will put up three sheltersone for you one for Moses and one for Elijah
175 While he was still speaking a bright cloud enveloped them and a voice from the cloud said This is my Son whom I love with him I am well pleased Listen to him
176 When the disciples heard this they fell facedown to the ground terrified
177 But Jesus came and touched them Get up he said Dont be afraid
178 When they looked up they saw no one except Jesus
179 As they were coming down the mountain Jesus instructed them Dont tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead
1710 The disciples asked him Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first
1711 Jesus replied To be sure Elijah comes and will restore all things
1712 But I tell you Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but have done to him everything they wished In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands
1713 Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist
1714 When they came to the crowd a man approached Jesus and knelt before him
1715 Lord have mercy on my son he said He has seizures and is suffering greatly He often falls into the fire or into the water
1716 I brought him to your disciples but they could not heal him
1717 O unbelieving and perverse generation Jesus replied how long shall I stay with you How long shall I put up with you Bring the boy here to me
1718 Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed from that moment
1719 Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked Why couldnt we drive it out
1720 He replied Because you have so little faith I tell you the truth if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain Move from here to there and it will move Nothing will be impossible for you
1721
1722 When they came together in Galilee he said to them The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men
1723 They will kill him and on the third day he will be raised to life And the disciples were filled with grief
1724 After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum the collectors of the twodrachma tax came to Peter and asked Doesnt your teacher pay the temple tax
1725 Yes he does he replied When Peter came into the house Jesus was the first to speak What do you think Simon he asked From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxesfrom their own sons or from others
1726 From others Peter answered Then the sons are exempt Jesus said to him
1727 But so that we may not offend them go to the lake and throw out your line Take the first fish you catch open its mouth and you will find a fourdrachma coin Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours 
181 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
182 He called a little child and had him stand among them
183 And he said I tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
184 Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
185 And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me
186 But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea
187 Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin Such things must come but woe to the man through whom they come
188 If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire
189 And if your eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell
1810 See that you do not look down on one of these little ones For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven
1811 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost
1812 What do you think If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the ninetynine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off
1813 And if he finds it I tell you the truth he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninetynine that did not wander off
1814 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost
1815 If your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you If he listens to you you have won your brother over
1816 But if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses
1817 If he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
1818 I tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
1819 Again I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for it will be done for you by my Father in heaven
1820 For where two or three come together in my name there am I with them
1821 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me Up to seven times
1822 Jesus answered I tell you not seven times but seventyseven times
1823 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants
1824 As he began the settlement a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him
1825 Since he was not able to pay the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt
1826 The servant fell on his knees before him Be patient with me he begged and I will pay back everything
1827 The servants master took pity on him canceled the debt and let him go
1828 But when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii He grabbed him and began to choke him Pay back what you owe me he demanded
1829 His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him Be patient with me and I will pay you back
1830 But he refused Instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt
1831 When the other servants saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened
1832 Then the master called the servant in You wicked servant he said I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to
1833 Shouldnt you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you
1834 In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed
1835 This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart 
191 When Jesus had finished saying these things he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan
192 Large crowds followed him and he healed them there
193 Some Pharisees came to him to test him They asked Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason
194 Havent you read he replied that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female
195 and said For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh
196 So they are no longer two but one Therefore what God has joined together let man not separate
197 Why then they asked did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away
198 Jesus replied Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard But it was not this way from the beginning
199 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery
1910 The disciples said to him If this is the situation between a husband and wife it is better not to marry
1911 Jesus replied Not everyone can accept this word but only those to whom it has been given
1912 For some are eunuchs because they were born that way others were made that way by men and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven The one who can accept this should accept it
1913 Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them But the disciples rebuked those who brought them
1914 Jesus said Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
1915 When he had placed his hands on them he went on from there
1916 Now a man came up to Jesus and asked Teacher what good thing must I do to get eternal life
1917 Why do you ask me about what is good Jesus replied There is only One who is good If you want to enter life obey the commandments
1918 Which ones the man inquired Jesus replied Do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not give false testimony
1919 honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself
1920 All these I have kept the young man said What do I still lack
1921 Jesus answered If you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven Then come follow me
1922 When the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth
1923 Then Jesus said to his disciples I tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
1924 Again I tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God
1925 When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished and asked Who then can be saved
1926 Jesus looked at them and said With man this is impossible but with God all things are possible
1927 Peter answered him We have left everything to follow you What then will there be for us
1928 Jesus said to them I tell you the truth at the renewal of all things when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel
1929 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life
1930 But many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first 
201 For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard
202 He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard
203 About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing
204 He told them You also go and work in my vineyard and I will pay you whatever is right
205 So they went He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing
206 About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around He asked them Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing
207 Because no one has hired us they answered He said to them You also go and work in my vineyard
208 When evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman Call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first
209 The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius
2010 So when those came who were hired first they expected to receive more But each one of them also received a denarius
2011 When they received it they began to grumble against the landowner
2012 These men who were hired last worked only one hour they said and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day
2013 But he answered one of them Friend I am not being unfair to you Didnt you agree to work for a denarius
2014 Take your pay and go I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you
2015 Dont I have the right to do what I want with my own money Or are you envious because I am generous
2016 So the last will be first and the first will be last
2017 Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them
2018 We are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law They will condemn him to death
2019 and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified On the third day he will be raised to life
2020 Then the mother of Zebedees sons came to Jesus with her sons and kneeling down asked a favor of him
2021 What is it you want he asked She said Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom
2022 You dont know what you are asking Jesus said to them Can you drink the cup I am going to drink We can they answered
2023 Jesus said to them You will indeed drink from my cup but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father
2024 When the ten heard about this they were indignant with the two brothers
2025 Jesus called them together and said You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them
2026 Not so with you Instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant
2027 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave
2028 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
2029 As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho a large crowd followed him
2030 Two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that Jesus was going by they shouted Lord Son of David have mercy on us
2031 The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet but they shouted all the louder Lord Son of David have mercy on us
2032 Jesus stopped and called them What do you want me to do for you he asked
2033 Lord they answered we want our sight
2034 Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes Immediately they received their sight and followed him MAT 
211 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives Jesus sent two disciples
212 saying to them Go to the village ahead of you and at once you will find a donkey tied there with her colt by her Untie them and bring them to me
213 If anyone says anything to you tell him that the Lord needs them and he will send them right away
214 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet
215 Say to the Daughter of Zion See your king comes to you gentle and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey
216 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them
217 They brought the donkey and the colt placed their cloaks on them and Jesus sat on them
218 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road
219 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted Hosanna to the Son of David Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest
2110 When Jesus entered Jerusalem the whole city was stirred and asked Who is this
2111 The crowds answered This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee
2112 Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves
2113 It is written he said to them My house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers
2114 The blind and the lame came to him at the temple and he healed them
2115 But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area Hosanna to the Son of David they were indignant
2116 Do you hear what these children are saying they asked him Yes replied Jesus have you never read From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise
2117 And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany where he spent the night
2118 Early in the morning as he was on his way back to the city he was hungry
2119 Seeing a fig tree by the road he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves Then he said to it May you never bear fruit again Immediately the tree withered
2120 When the disciples saw this they were amazed How did the fig tree wither so quickly they asked
2121 Jesus replied I tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain Go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done
2122 If you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer
2123 Jesus entered the temple courts and while he was teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him By what authority are you doing these things they asked And who gave you this authority
2124 Jesus replied I will also ask you one question If you answer me I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things
2125 Johns baptismwhere did it come from Was it from heaven or from men They discussed it among themselves and said If we say From heaven he will ask Then why didnt you believe him
2126 But if we say From menwe are afraid of the people for they all hold that John was a prophet
2127 So they answered Jesus We dont know Then he said Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things
2128 What do you think There was a man who had two sons He went to the first and said Son go and work today in the vineyard
2129 I will not he answered but later he changed his mind and went
2130 Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing He answered I will sir but he did not go
2131 Which of the two did what his father wanted The first they answered Jesus said to them I tell you the truth the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you
2132 For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did And even after you saw this you did not repent and believe him
2133 Listen to another parable There was a landowner who planted a vineyard He put a wall around it dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey
2134 When the harvest time approached he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit
2135 The tenants seized his servants they beat one killed another and stoned a third
2136 Then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them the same way
2137 Last of all he sent his son to them They will respect my son he said
2138 But when the tenants saw the son they said to each other This is the heir Come lets kill him and take his inheritance
2139 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
2140 Therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
2141 He will bring those wretches to a wretched end they replied and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time
2142 Jesus said to them Have you never read in the Scriptures The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone the Lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes
2143 Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit
2144 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed
2145 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus parables they knew he was talking about them
2146 They looked for a way to arrest him but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet 
221 Jesus spoke to them again in parables saying
222 The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son
223 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come but they refused to come
224 Then he sent some more servants and said Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and everything is ready Come to the wedding banquet
225 But they paid no attention and went offone to his field another to his business
226 The rest seized his servants mistreated them and killed them
227 The king was enraged He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city
228 Then he said to his servants The wedding banquet is ready but those I invited did not deserve to come
229 Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find
2210 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find both good and bad and the wedding hall was filled with guests
2211 But when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes
2212 Friend he asked how did you get in here without wedding clothes The man was speechless
2213 Then the king told the attendants Tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2214 For many are invited but few are chosen
2215 Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words
2216 They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians Teacher they said we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth You arent swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are
2217 Tell us then what is your opinion Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not
2218 But Jesus knowing their evil intent said You hypocrites why are you trying to trap me
2219 Show me the coin used for paying the tax They brought him a denarius
2220 and he asked them Whose portrait is this And whose inscription
2221 Caesars they replied Then he said to them Give to Caesar what is Caesars and to God what is Gods
2222 When they heard this they were amazed So they left him and went away
2223 That same day the Sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question
2224 Teacher they said Moses told us that if a man dies without having children his brother must marry the widow and have children for him
2225 Now there were seven brothers among us The first one married and died and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother
2226 The same thing happened to the second and third brother right on down to the seventh
2227 Finally the woman died
2228 Now then at the resurrection whose wife will she be of the seven since all of them were married to her
2229 Jesus replied You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God
2230 At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven
2231 But about the resurrection of the deadhave you not read what God said to you
2232 I am the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob He is not the God of the dead but of the living
2233 When the crowds heard this they were astonished at his teaching
2234 Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees the Pharisees got together
2235 One of them an expert in the law tested him with this question
2236 Teacher which is the greatest commandment in the Law
2237 Jesus replied Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
2238 This is the first and greatest commandment
2239 And the second is like it Love your neighbor as yourself
2240 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments
2241 While the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them
2242 What do you think about the Christ Whose son is he The son of David they replied
2243 He said to them How is it then that David speaking by the Spirit calls him Lord For he says
2244 The Lord said to my Lord Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet
2245 If then David calls him Lord how can he be his son
2246 No one could say a word in reply and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions 
231 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples
232 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat
233 So you must obey them and do everything they tell you But do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach
234 They tie up heavy loads and put them on mens shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them
235 Everything they do is done for men to see They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long
236 they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues
237 they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them Rabbi
238 But you are not to be called Rabbi for you have only one Master and you are all brothers
239 And do not call anyone on earth father for you have one Father and he is in heaven
2310 Nor are you to be called teacher for you have one Teacher the Christ
2311 The greatest among you will be your servant
2312 For whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
2313 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You shut the kingdom of heaven in mens faces You yourselves do not enter nor will you let those enter who are trying to
2314
2315 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You travel over land and sea to win a single convert and when he becomes one you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are
2316 Woe to you blind guides You say If anyone swears by the temple it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is bound by his oath
2317 You blind fools Which is greater the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred
2318 You also say If anyone swears by the altar it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by his oath
2319 You blind men Which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred
2320 Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it
2321 And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it
2322 And he who swears by heaven swears by Gods throne and by the one who sits on it
2323 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You give a tenth of your spicesmint dill and cummin But you have neglected the more important matters of the lawjustice mercy and faithfulness You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former
2324 You blind guides You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel
2325 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You clean the outside of the cup and dish but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence
2326 Blind Pharisee First clean the inside of the cup and dish and then the outside also will be clean
2327 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean
2328 In the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness
2329 Woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you hypocrites You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous
2330 And you say If we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets
2331 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets
2332 Fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers
2333 You snakes You brood of vipers How will you escape being condemned to hell
2334 Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers Some of them you will kill and crucify others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town
2335 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar
2336 I tell you the truth all this will come upon this generation
2337 O Jerusalem Jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing
2338 Look your house is left to you desolate
2339 For I tell you you will not see me again until you say Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord 
241 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings
242 Do you see all these things he asked I tell you the truth not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down
243 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately Tell us they said when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age
244 Jesus answered Watch out that no one deceives you
245 For many will come in my name claiming I am the Christ and will deceive many
246 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed Such things must happen but the end is still to come
247 Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom There will be famines and earthquakes in various places
248 All these are the beginning of birth pains
249 Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me
2410 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other
2411 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people
2412 Because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold
2413 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved
2414 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come
2415 So when you see standing in the holy place the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet Daniellet the reader understand
2416 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains
2417 Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house
2418 Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak
2419 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers
2420 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath
2421 For then there will be great distress unequaled from the beginning of the world until nowand never to be equaled again
2422 If those days had not been cut short no one would survive but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened
2423 At that time if anyone says to you Look here is the Christ or There he is do not believe it
2424 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the electif that were possible
2425 See I have told you ahead of time
2426 So if anyone tells you There he is out in the desert do not go out or Here he is in the inner rooms do not believe it
2427 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west so will be the coming of the Son of Man
2428 Wherever there is a carcass there the vultures will gather
2429 Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken
2430 At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory
2431 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other
2432 Now learn this lesson from the fig tree As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near
2433 Even so when you see all these things you know that it is near right at the door
2434 I tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened
2435 Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away
2436 No one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the Son but only the Father
2437 As it was in the days of Noah so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man
2438 For in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark
2439 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man
2440 Two men will be in the field one will be taken and the other left
2441 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill one will be taken and the other left
2442 Therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come
2443 But understand this If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into
2444 So you also must be ready because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him
2445 Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time
2446 It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns
2447 I tell you the truth he will put him in charge of all his possessions
2448 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself My master is staying away a long time
2449 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards
2450 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of
2451 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth 
251 At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom
252 Five of them were foolish and five were wise
253 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them
254 The wise however took oil in jars along with their lamps
255 The bridegroom was a long time in coming and they all became drowsy and fell asleep
256 At midnight the cry rang out Heres the bridegroom Come out to meet him
257 Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps
258 The foolish ones said to the wise Give us some of your oil our lamps are going out
259 No they replied there may not be enough for both us and you Instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves
2510 But while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet And the door was shut
2511 Later the others also came Sir Sir they said Open the door for us
2512 But he replied I tell you the truth I dont know you
2513 Therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour
2514 Again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them
2515 To one he gave five talents of money to another two talents and to another one talent each according to his ability Then he went on his journey
2516 The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more
2517 So also the one with the two talents gained two more
2518 But the man who had received the one talent went off dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money
2519 After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them
2520 The man who had received the five talents brought the other five Master he said you entrusted me with five talents See I have gained five more
2521 His master replied Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things Come and share your masters happiness
2522 The man with the two talents also came Master he said you entrusted me with two talents see I have gained two more
2523 His master replied Well done good and faithful servant You have been faithful with a few things I will put you in charge of many things Come and share your masters happiness
2524 Then the man who had received the one talent came Master he said I knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed
2525 So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground See here is what belongs to you
2526 His master replied You wicked lazy servant So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed
2527 Well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest
2528 Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
2529 For everyone who has will be given more and he will have an abundance Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him
2530 And throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2531 When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
2532 All the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats
2533 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left
2534 Then the King will say to those on his right Come you who are blessed by my Father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
2535 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink I was a stranger and you invited me in
2536 I needed clothes and you clothed me I was sick and you looked after me I was in prison and you came to visit me
2537 Then the righteous will answer him Lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
2538 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you
2539 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
2540 The King will reply I tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
2541 Then he will say to those on his left Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
2542 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink
2543 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in I needed clothes and you did not clothe me I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me
2544 They also will answer Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
2545 He will reply I tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
2546 Then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life 
261 When Jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples
262 As you know the Passover is two days awayand the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified
263 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest whose name was Caiaphas
264 and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him
265 But not during the Feast they said or there may be a riot among the people
266 While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper
267 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table
268 When the disciples saw this they were indignant Why this waste they asked
269 This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor
2610 Aware of this Jesus said to them Why are you bothering this woman She has done a beautiful thing to me
2611 The poor you will always have with you but you will not always have me
2612 When she poured this perfume on my body she did it to prepare me for burial
2613 I tell you the truth wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her
2614 Then one of the Twelvethe one called Judas Iscariotwent to the chief priests
2615 and asked What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you So they counted out for him thirty silver coins
2616 From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over
2617 On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover
2618 He replied Go into the city to a certain man and tell him The Teacher says My appointed time is near I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house
2619 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover
2620 When evening came Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve
2621 And while they were eating he said I tell you the truth one of you will betray me
2622 They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other Surely not I Lord
2623 Jesus replied The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me
2624 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man It would be better for him if he had not been born
2625 Then Judas the one who would betray him said Surely not I Rabbi Jesus answered Yes it is you
2626 While they were eating Jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying Take and eat this is my body
2627 Then he took the cup gave thanks and offered it to them saying Drink from it all of you
2628 This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
2629 I tell you I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Fathers kingdom
2630 When they had sung a hymn they went out to the Mount of Olives
2631 Then Jesus told them This very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered
2632 But after I have risen I will go ahead of you into Galilee
2633 Peter replied Even if all fall away on account of you I never will
2634 I tell you the truth Jesus answered this very night before the rooster crows you will disown me three times
2635 But Peter declared Even if I have to die with you I will never disown you And all the other disciples said the same
2636 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane and he said to them Sit here while I go over there and pray
2637 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled
2638 Then he said to them My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death Stay here and keep watch with me
2639 Going a little farther he fell with his face to the ground and prayed My Father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me Yet not as I will but as you will
2640 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour he asked Peter
2641 Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation The spirit is willing but the body is weak
2642 He went away a second time and prayed My Father if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it may your will be done
2643 When he came back he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy
2644 So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time saying the same thing
2645 Then he returned to the disciples and said to them Are you still sleeping and resting Look the hour is near and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
2646 Rise let us go Here comes my betrayer
2647 While he was still speaking Judas one of the Twelve arrived With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people
2648 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them The one I kiss is the man arrest him
2649 Going at once to Jesus Judas said Greetings Rabbi and kissed him
2650 Jesus replied Friend do what you came for Then the men stepped forward seized Jesus and arrested him
2651 With that one of Jesus companions reached for his sword drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear
2652 Put your sword back in its place Jesus said to him for all who draw the sword will die by the sword
2653 Do you think I cannot call on my Father and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels
2654 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way
2655 At that time Jesus said to the crowd Am I leading a rebellion that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching and you did not arrest me
2656 But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled Then all the disciples deserted him and fled
2657 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled
2658 But Peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome
2659 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death
2660 But they did not find any though many false witnesses came forward Finally two came forward
2661 and declared This fellow said I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days
2662 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus Are you not going to answer What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you
2663 But Jesus remained silent The high priest said to him I charge you under oath by the living God Tell us if you are the Christ the Son of God
2664 Yes it is as you say Jesus replied But I say to all of you In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven
2665 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said He has spoken blasphemy Why do we need any more witnesses Look now you have heard the blasphemy
2666 What do you think He is worthy of death they answered
2667 Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists Others slapped him
2668 and said Prophesy to us Christ Who hit you
2669 Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him You also were with Jesus of Galilee she said
2670 But he denied it before them all I dont know what youre talking about he said
2671 Then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth
2672 He denied it again with an oath I dont know the man
2673 After a little while those standing there went up to Peter and said Surely you are one of them for your accent gives you away
2674 Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them I dont know the man Immediately a rooster crowed
2675 Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken Before the rooster crows you will disown me three times And he went outside and wept bitterly 
271 Early in the morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death
272 They bound him led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor
273 When Judas who had betrayed him saw that Jesus was condemned he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders
274 I have sinned he said for I have betrayed innocent blood What is that to us they replied Thats your responsibility
275 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left Then he went away and hanged himself
276 The chief priests picked up the coins and said It is against the law to put this into the treasury since it is blood money
277 So they decided to use the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for foreigners
278 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day
279 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled They took the thirty silver coins the price set on him by the people of Israel
2710 and they used them to buy the potters field as the Lord commanded me
2711 Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him Are you the king of the Jews Yes it is as you say Jesus replied
2712 When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he gave no answer
2713 Then Pilate asked him Dont you hear the testimony they are bringing against you
2714 But Jesus made no reply not even to a single chargeto the great amazement of the governor
2715 Now it was the governors custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd
2716 At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas
2717 So when the crowd had gathered Pilate asked them Which one do you want me to release to you Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ
2718 For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him
2719 While Pilate was sitting on the judges seat his wife sent him this message Dont have anything to do with that innocent man for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him
2720 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed
2721 Which of the two do you want me to release to you asked the governor Barabbas they answered
2722 What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ Pilate asked They all answered Crucify him
2723 Why What crime has he committed asked Pilate But they shouted all the louder Crucify him
2724 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere but that instead an uproar was starting he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd I am innocent of this mans blood he said It is your responsibility
2725 All the people answered Let his blood be on us and on our children
2726 Then he released Barabbas to them But he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified
2727 Then the governors soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him
2728 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him
2729 and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him Hail king of the Jews they said
2730 They spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again
2731 After they had mocked him they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him Then they led him away to crucify him
2732 As they were going out they met a man from Cyrene named Simon and they forced him to carry the cross
2733 They came to a place called Golgotha which means The Place of the Skull
2734 There they offered Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall but after tasting it he refused to drink it
2735 When they had crucified him they divided up his clothes by casting lots
2736 And sitting down they kept watch over him there
2737 Above his head they placed the written charge against him THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS
2738 Two robbers were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left
2739 Those who passed by hurled insults at him shaking their heads
2740 and saying You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God
2741 In the same way the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him
2742 He saved others they said but he cant save himself Hes the King of Israel Let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him
2743 He trusts in God Let God rescue him now if he wants him for he said I am the Son of God
2744 In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him
2745 From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land
2746 About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice Eloi Eloi lama sabachthaniwhich means My God my God why have you forsaken me
2747 When some of those standing there heard this they said Hes calling Elijah
2748 Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge He filled it with wine vinegar put it on a stick and offered it to Jesus to drink
2749 The rest said Now leave him alone Lets see if Elijah comes to save him
2750 And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice he gave up his spirit
2751 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom The earth shook and the rocks split
2752 The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life
2753 They came out of the tombs and after Jesus resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people
2754 When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened they were terrified and exclaimed Surely he was the Son of God
2755 Many women were there watching from a distance They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs
2756 Among them were Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of Zebedees sons
2757 As evening approached there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph who had himself become a disciple of Jesus
2758 Going to Pilate he asked for Jesus body and Pilate ordered that it be given to him
2759 Joseph took the body wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
2760 and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away
2761 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb
2762 The next day the one after Preparation Day the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate
2763 Sir they said we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said After three days I will rise again
2764 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day Otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead This last deception will be worse than the first
2765 Take a guard Pilate answered Go make the tomb as secure as you know how
2766 So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard 
281 After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb
282 There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it
283 His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow
284 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men
285 The angel said to the women Do not be afraid for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified
286 He is not here he has risen just as he said Come and see the place where he lay
287 Then go quickly and tell his disciples He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee There you will see him Now I have told you
288 So the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell his disciples
289 Suddenly Jesus met them Greetings he said They came to him clasped his feet and worshiped him
2810 Then Jesus said to them Do not be afraid Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee there they will see me
2811 While the women were on their way some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened
2812 When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
2813 telling them You are to say His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep
2814 If this report gets to the governor we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble
2815 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day
2816 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go
2817 When they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted
2818 Then Jesus came to them and said All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
2819 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
